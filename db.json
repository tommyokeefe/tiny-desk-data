It's a record, more than a decade into the band's career, that not only exposes the sparkling pop that's always lit Paramore's songs, but also deals with the ache of growing up and growing apart. When Hayley Williams sings, \"Tell my friends I'm coming down / We'll kick it when I hit the ground\" from the '80s-tastic jam \"Hard Times\" at the Tiny Desk, the stark dichotomy is laid bare by the band's stripped-down performance that still packs a small synth and Zac Farro's drum machine into its Afro-pop-flecked textures."

The mentions were properly placed and added substance to the performance, but to me, he pulled what I'd call a \"subtle stunt.\" Hip-hop is and has always been about youth and freshness, so most elder statesmen of rap aren't celebrated to the degree of their peers in rock 'n' roll and country music.

Among those songs were \"SGL\" and \"Yours,\" the two singles that heralded the band's return this summer (a full five years after <em>Threads</em>, with a pared-down lineup and no album yet announced, though the rumors say next year). As their performance here makes clear, KC Dalager and Bradley Hale have added a few new tools to their arsenal \u2014 synth-forward arrangements, that triplet swagger you loved from \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TffpkE2GU4\">The Wire</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeccAtqd5K8\">Run Away With Me</a>,\" the word \"baby\" \u2014 but their focus on tiny moments between people just outside of love is as sharp as ever.

In the years since that iconic and much-beloved rock band broke up in 2000, Corgan has continued to put out music under various names and projects \u2013 including several releases as Smashing Pumpkins, with different lineups \u2013 while often stumbling through a bumpy minefield of his own making. To the head-scratching surprise of some longtime fans, he's gotten heavily involved in pro wrestling, talked conspiracy theories during several appearances on <em>The Alex Jones Show </em>(warning of weaponized zombies in one interview),<em> </em>and, over the years, lobbed innumerable grievances about former bandmates, while trashing other musicians and publicly feuding with a revolving cast of celebrities and public figures."

Greilsammer follows by jumping ahead 175 years to the eccentric Frenchman <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/artists/91146991/erik-satie\">Erik Satie</a>, who not only owned seven identical gray velvet suits but, with a freewheeling spaciousness and humor in his music, is often thought of as the precursor to everything from minimalism to new age.

It's all in an attempt to understand human relationships and the sorts of couplings we tend to be drawn to. But despite the working and reworking it took to put these ideas to song, and to then make his brilliant debut, there's a spontaneous side that you'll see in this Tiny Desk Concert."

By the time he hit the first chorus of \"Can't Go Back,\" a danceable bop about accepting that the life you have isn't quite the one you planned for, any remaining cobwebs had been scattered to the wind."

And, at 23, he has a lot to say on the subject. His opening song at the Tiny Desk, \"Midnight 01 (Deep Sea Diver),\" includes the line, \"Why'd you leave me? Because of my depression? / You used to complete me but I guess I learnt a lesson.\" The song continues with water-sinking metaphors and how he deals with the pressure. All this comes from someone who honestly looks like he couldn't care less, which seems like a far cry from the words and care he puts into his twisted, woozy tones."

Ranglin was a key figure in shaping the sounds of ska \u2014 influenced by New Orleans jazz and R&B \u2014 in Jamaica in the late 1950s. But most of the world wouldn't hear of ska until producer Chris Blackwell teamed Ranglin up with a Jamaican singer named Millie Small. Together, they recorded \"My Boy Lollipop,\" a song that became a smash at the height of Beatlemania and helped put ska and Jamaican music on the map forever."

The effects of Ranglin's fluid and rhythmic playing on Jamaican music, from mento to reggae, are deep and long-lasting. But his work as a jazz artist is equally amazing, and here at the Tiny Desk he does a bit of everything, including music from his lyrical and wonderful album <em>Bless Up</em>. So watch as this humble, charming gentleman makes magic on guitar, with his talented young band Avila holding down the beat."

When he finally picked up the guitar and wrote a handful of songs for a demo, the tape found its way to David Byrne's Luaka Bop label, which has been releasing White's music ever since.
